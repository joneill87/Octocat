We'll use this website to demonstrate how to use git in today's class.

## Creating an empty repository

1. In your GitHub Desktop app click on *File* -> *New Repository...*

2. On the *create* tab type a name for your repository (note you name has to have a hyphen instead of spaces **eg. cfg-project-1**). Before you press *create repository* make a note of the **local path** as this shows where to find the code folder on your computer.

3. When you're happy, click on *Create Repository*. Then find and open the code folder on your computer. You're new repository is ready to go!

## Getting the code

4. Click on the *Clone or Download* button and select *Download as zip*

5. Right-click the files and select *Extract all...*  (or double-click the zip folder on mac)

6. Go inside the folder, and copy all of the contents into your empty repository code folder

## Committing your changes

7. Open up your GitHub Desktop application. You should see a list of all of the new files you have copied in. We're going to **commit** (finalize) these changes, now. Make sure the checkbox to the left of each file is ticked.

8. Fill out a very short description (max 72 characters) of what you've just done in the Textbox called 
*Summary*. You need to do this every time you commit files. 

9. It's good practice to fill out the *Description* textbox, too. The description can be as long as you like so you can use it when the summary doesn't give you enough space.

10. When you're happy with the description and summary click the button labelled *commit to master*. You've now saved your commit **locally** (only on your computer)

## Pushing Your Changes

11. In order to make sure everyone can see your changes we need to *publish* (or *push*) our commit. Click on the button with the sync icon in the top-right corner of the GitHub app.

12. To make sure your changes have been published, click on the History tab on the left side of the GitHub client window. You should see your commit summary and commit description. If you click on it you should also see a list of all the files that were included.

13. Congratulations! You've just published your first commit!
